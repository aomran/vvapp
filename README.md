# Voix Visuelle Project

This rails application is being created to ease the administrative process at the art gallery - Voix Visuelle. Right now artists mail in their work and application forms on a CD/DVD. A lot of manual work is involved during the processing of these submissions. The goal is to automate as much of this process as possible.

Artists will be able to create accounts and store their personal information. They are then given the opportunity to make their submissions to the shows online.

The admin team at Voix Visuelle will have most of the work already done for them by the rails application, they can focus on evaluating the work and making decisions.
